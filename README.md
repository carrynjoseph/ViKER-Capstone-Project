# ViKER-CapstoneProject
 Final year project: EER/ARM Transformation tool

## Description
This project was in partial completion of my BSc degree.
The objective of this project was to complete a software developement project including all phases from gethering requirements to building the software for the client (supervisor). The program converts an ARM diagram into and EER diagram and vice versa. It does this by extracting the elements of the diagram and putting them in the new diagram format.

## Report
The report goes into detail on the stages of development - requirement analysis, designing and implementing. It also explains how the code works.
